Name:

   Pandaboard Mini Distribution

About:

   A basic GNU/Linux distribution for the Pandaboard

Main features:

   * Arm Cortex A9 optimized
   * Glibc based toolchain
   * Systemd init system
   * GNU/Linux system utilities (no busybox)
   * Ethernet and wifi network support
   * OpenSSH client/server

Main builds:

   fs      - Filesystem
   linux   - Linux kernel
   u-boot  - Bootloader

Quick build guide:

   buildgear build fs
   buildgear build linux
   buildgear build u-boot

Build system requirements:

   Tested on Ubuntu 12.04 Minimal with the following additional packages 
   installed:

   $ sudo apt-get install unzip mtd-utils groff bison flex gperf texinfo \
                          libtool automake libncurses5-dev gawk libexpat1-dev \
                          gettext u-boot-tools libglib2.0-dev intltool


   Also, reconfiguring "/bin/sh" to use bash is required:

   $ sudo dpkg-reconfigure dash

   Fact: many software distributions fail to build using the dash shell.

Known issues:

   None

Filesystem layout:

   /usr/bin/            User binaries
   /usr/sbin/           System binaries (daemons, system utilities, etc.)
   /usr/lib/            Libraries
   /usr/lib/<prog>/     Program specific libraries (plug-ins, addons, etc.)
   /usr/include/        Header files
   /usr/share/man/      Man pages
   /usr/share/<prog>/   Program data files shared across all architectures
   /usr/etc/<prog>/     Configuration files for user programs
   /etc/                Configuration files for system programs

   The filesystem directory hierachy is arranged according to the FHS 2.3 
   standard with the exceptions that /bin and /sbin are unused. Instead all
   software make use of /usr/bin and /usr/sbin. For backwards compatibility
   /bin and /sbin remain links to /usr/bin and /usr/sbin respectively.
