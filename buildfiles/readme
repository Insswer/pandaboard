Filesystem layout:

   /usr/bin/            User binaries
   /usr/sbin/           System binaries (daemons, system utilities, etc.)
   /usr/lib/            Libraries
   /usr/lib/<prog>/     Program specific libraries (plug-ins, addons, etc.)
   /usr/include/        Header files
   /usr/share/man/      Man pages
   /usr/share/<prog>/   Program data files shared across all architectures
   /usr/etc/<prog>/     Configuration files for user programs
   /etc/                Configuration files for system programs

   The filesystem directory hierachy is arranged according to the FHS 2.3 
   standard with the exceptions that /bin and /sbin are unused. Instead all
   software make use of /usr/bin and /usr/sbin. For backwards compatibility
   /bin and /sbin remain links to /usr/bin and /usr/sbin respectively.
